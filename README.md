# Dockyard

Run multiple isolated Docker daemons on a single host, each with its own network, storage, and socket — without touching the system Docker.

## Why?

The stock Docker daemon is a singleton. You get one `dockerd`, one bridge, one set of iptables rules. If you need isolation between workloads — different runtimes, different networks, different storage — you're stuck with hacks or heavyweight VMs.

Dockyard spins up fully independent Docker instances that:

- **Run sysbox-runc by default** — containers that can run systemd, Docker-in-Docker, and other system workloads without `--privileged`
- **Coexist peacefully** — each instance gets its own bridge, subnet, containerd, socket, and data directory. No shared state, no conflicts
- **Manage their own firewall rules** — no more iptables chain clobbering between daemons (a real problem with multiple dockerd instances)
- **Survive reboots** — systemd services with proper dependency ordering, automatic restart, and clean teardown
- **Install in seconds** — one command generates config, another downloads Docker + sysbox binaries, generates a self-contained systemd service, and starts everything

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thieso2/dockyard/refs/heads/main/dockyard.sh && chmod +x dockyard.sh

# Generate a config with randomized, conflict-free networks
./dockyard.sh gen-env

# Create instance
sudo ./dockyard.sh create

# Run a container (uses sysbox-runc automatically)
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///dockyard/docker.sock docker run --rm -it alpine ash
```

## Multiple Instances

Each instance needs its own config file with unique values. Use `gen-env` with overrides to create them:

```bash
# First instance (defaults: dy_ prefix, /dockyard root)
./dockyard.sh gen-env
sudo ./dockyard.sh create

# Second instance (custom prefix and root)
DOCKYARD_DOCKER_PREFIX=tc_ DOCKYARD_ROOT=/docker2 DOCKYARD_ENV=./docker2.env ./dockyard.sh gen-env
DOCKYARD_ENV=./docker2.env sudo -E ./dockyard.sh create
```

`gen-env` randomizes bridge and pool networks from `172.16.0.0/12`, checks for conflicts against `ip route` and existing installations, and writes a clean config file:

```bash
# Dockyard configuration
# Generated by: dockyard.sh gen-env

DOCKYARD_ROOT=/dockyard
DOCKYARD_DOCKER_PREFIX=dy_
DOCKYARD_BRIDGE_CIDR=172.22.147.1/24
DOCKYARD_FIXED_CIDR=172.22.147.0/24
DOCKYARD_POOL_BASE=172.28.0.0/16
DOCKYARD_POOL_SIZE=24
```

Each instance runs independently with its own systemd service (`dy_docker`, `tc_docker`, etc.), its own bridge, and its own iptables rules scoped to its bridge interface.

## Commands

```bash
./dockyard.sh gen-env [--nocheck]                            # Generate dockyard.env
sudo ./dockyard.sh create [--no-systemd] [--no-start]       # Create instance
sudo ./dockyard.sh destroy                                    # Remove instance completely
./dockyard.sh status                                          # Show diagnostics
sudo ./dockyard.sh start                                      # Start manually (no systemd)
sudo ./dockyard.sh stop                                       # Stop manually (no systemd)
```

All commands except `gen-env` require a config file. Lookup order:
1. `$DOCKYARD_ENV` if set → use that file
2. `./dockyard.env` in current directory

## What Gets Installed

The installer downloads static binaries (cached in `.tmp/` for repeated installs):

| Software | Version | Binaries |
|----------|---------|----------|
| [Docker CE](https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/) | 29.2.1 | dockerd, containerd, docker, ctr, runc, etc. |
| [Docker Rootless Extras](https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/) | 29.2.1 | dockerd-rootless, vpnkit, rootlesskit, etc. |
| [Sysbox CE](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox) | 0.6.7 | sysbox-runc, sysbox-mgr, sysbox-fs |

```
${DOCKYARD_ROOT}/
├── docker.sock                     # Docker API socket
├── docker/                         # Images, containers, volumes

└── docker-runtime/
    ├── bin/                        # dockerd, containerd, sysbox-runc (static binaries)
    ├── etc/
    │   ├── daemon.json             # Daemon configuration
    │   └── dockyard.env            # Copy of config (written by create)
    ├── log/                        # containerd.log, dockerd.log
    └── run/                        # PID files

/etc/systemd/system/${PREFIX}docker.service   # Self-contained systemd unit
/run/${PREFIX}docker/                         # Runtime state (tmpfs)
```

The systemd service file is generated with all paths hardcoded at create time. It has no dependency on this repository — you can delete the repo after creation and everything keeps running.

## How Networking Works

Each instance creates its own Linux bridge and manages its own iptables rules. Docker's built-in iptables management is disabled (`--iptables=false`) because multiple daemons fight over shared chain names like `DOCKER-FORWARD` — whichever starts last wins and breaks the others.

Instead, each service adds four rules on startup and removes them on shutdown:

```
iptables -I FORWARD -i dy_docker0 -o dy_docker0 -j ACCEPT                              # container ↔ container
iptables -I FORWARD -i dy_docker0 ! -o dy_docker0 -j ACCEPT                             # container → internet
iptables -I FORWARD -o dy_docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT   # internet → container (replies)
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s 172.30.0.0/24 ! -o dy_docker0 -j MASQUERADE           # NAT for outbound
```

Every rule is scoped to the instance's bridge name, so instances can never interfere with each other or with the system Docker.

## Accessing the System Docker

While dockyard instances are running, the system Docker still works normally:

```bash
docker -H unix:///run/docker.sock ps        # system docker
docker -H unix:///dockyard/docker.sock ps  # dockyard instance
```

Or set `DOCKER_HOST` to make a dockyard instance the default:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///dockyard/docker.sock
```

## Prerequisites

- Linux with systemd
- sysbox installed and running (`sysbox-fs.service`, `sysbox-mgr.service`)
- `curl`, `tar`, `dpkg-deb` for binary downloads
- Root access for installation

## Destroy

```bash
sudo ./dockyard.sh destroy

# For a non-default instance
DOCKYARD_ENV=./docker2.env sudo -E ./dockyard.sh destroy
```

This stops the daemon, disables the systemd service, and removes all data including images and containers.

Dockyard's niche: multi-daemon orchestration with per-instance network isolation, sysbox-runc as default runtime, and self-contained systemd services.
